# Project Overview
This project represents a detailed analysis of Atliq Mart’s promotional campaigns during the Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024 seasons. Utilizing advanced data analytics and
visualization techniques, I dissected the performance of various promotion types across multiple store locations in Southern India. The project’s findings have significant
implications for future marketing strategies and operational efficiency.


# Project Introduction
Atliq Mart, a leading retail chain in Southern India, conducted extensive promotional campaigns during two major festive seasons—Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024. As the primary
analyst for this project, my role was to evaluate the effectiveness of these campaigns by analyzing large datasets using SQL and Power BI. The goal was to identify trends, assess
the impact of different promotion types, and provide actionable recommendations to enhance future campaigns.

# Key Findings
BOGOF and Cashback Offers Lead in Revenue and Sales: BOGOF and cashback promotions generated the highest revenue and sales, outperforming discount-based offers.
Personal Care Products Lagging: Personal care products had lower sales, likely due to the focus on other categories during the festival season.
Home Appliances and Home Care Excellence: The Home Appliances and Home Care categories performed exceptionally well, contributing to 50% of overall sales and revenue post
promotion.
Major Revenue from Key Cities: 50% of the revenue was generated from stores in Bengaluru, Chennai, and Mysuru, highlighting the significance of these markets.
Stores Expansion: Hyderabad though with higher number of stores lagged in Incremental Revenue / Incremental Sold Units during promotions.
