# Project Overview
This project represents a detailed analysis of Atliq Mart’s promotional campaigns during the Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024 seasons. Utilizing advanced data analytics and
visualization techniques, I dissected the performance of various promotion types across multiple store locations in Southern India. The project’s findings have significant
implications for future marketing strategies and operational efficiency.


# Project Introduction
Atliq Mart, a leading retail chain in Southern India, conducted extensive promotional campaigns during two major festive seasons—Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024. As the primary
analyst for this project, my role was to evaluate the effectiveness of these campaigns by analyzing large datasets using SQL and Power BI. The goal was to identify trends, assess
the impact of different promotion types, and provide actionable recommendations to enhance future campaigns.
